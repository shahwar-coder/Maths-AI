    "# 🧮 Maths for AI – Environment & Kernel Setup (Local, VS Code)\n",
    "\n",
    "This document records the exact steps followed to set up a **clean Python environment**\n",
    "and connect it correctly to a **Jupyter Notebook kernel in VS Code**, before writing any code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**  \n",
    "Ensure that all maths notebooks use an isolated Python environment (`ai-maths`)  \n",
    "instead of system Python or Google Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Decide to Use a Separate Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:**\n",
    "- Keep maths libraries isolated (NumPy, SciPy, SymPy)\n",
    "- Avoid conflicts with backend / ML / GenAI projects\n",
    "- Professional habit: **one environment = one purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chosen environment name:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "ai-maths\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Navigate to Project Folder\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd ~/Documents/Math\\ Folder\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this does:**\n",
    "- Moves the terminal into the folder where maths notebooks and environment will live\n",
    "- Ensures the environment is created in the correct location\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 -m venv ai-maths\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this does:**\n",
    "- Creates an isolated Python environment inside `ai-maths/`\n",
    "- Copies a Python interpreter into `ai-maths/bin/python`\n",
    "- Keeps packages independent from system Python\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Activate the Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source ai-maths/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this does:**\n",
    "- Tells the terminal to use `ai-maths/bin/python`\n",
    "- Ensures `pip install` installs packages into this environment only\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Install Jupyter Kernel Support\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install ipykernel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this does:**\n",
    "- Installs `ipykernel` inside the environment\n",
    "- Allows the interpreter to be used as a Jupyter kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Register the Environment as a Jupyter Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m ipykernel install --user \\\n",
    "  --name ai-maths \\\n",
    "  --display-name \"Python (AI Maths)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this does:**\n",
    "- Registers the environment with Jupyter\n",
    "- Makes it selectable inside VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ Select Kernel in Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "**Path:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Select Kernel → Python Environments → Python (AI Maths)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8️⃣ Verify Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "sys.executable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected path should point to:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ai-maths/bin/python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Final State\n",
    "\n",
    "Your system is now ready for **Maths for AI** with a clean, isolated environment."
