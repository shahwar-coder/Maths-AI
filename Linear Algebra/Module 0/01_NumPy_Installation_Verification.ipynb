    "# 📦 NumPy Installation & Verification (ai-maths Environment)\n",
    "\n",
    "This document records the exact steps followed to install NumPy and verify that it is correctly available inside a Python virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Activate the Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source ai-maths/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this does:**\n",
    "- Activates the `ai-maths` virtual environment\n",
    "- Ensures all Python and pip commands now point to this environment\n",
    "- Terminal prompt changes to show `(ai-maths)`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Install NumPy Using pip\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this does:**\n",
    "- Downloads NumPy compatible with the active Python version\n",
    "- Installs it inside the `ai-maths` environment\n",
    "- Does NOT install a system-wide package\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observed result:**\n",
    "- NumPy was successfully installed\n",
    "- Version installed: `numpy 2.3.5`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ pip Installation Confirmation\n",
    "\n",
    "After installation, pip showed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Successfully installed numpy-2.3.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning:**\n",
    "- Installation completed without errors\n",
    "- NumPy is now present in the environment’s `site-packages`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Attempted (Incorrect) Verification Method\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "which numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:**\n",
    "```text\n",
    "numpy not found\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this happens:**\n",
    "- `numpy` is NOT a command-line executable\n",
    "- `which` only works for shell commands (like `python`, `pip`, `git`)\n",
    "- Python libraries cannot be found using `which`\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ This behavior is expected and NOT an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Correct Verification Method (Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -c \"import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this does:**\n",
    "- Launches Python from the active environment\n",
    "- Imports NumPy\n",
    "- Prints the installed NumPy version\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected output:**\n",
    "```text\n",
    "2.3.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This confirms NumPy is installed and usable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Verify via pip (Optional Check)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip show numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this does:**\n",
    "- Displays package metadata\n",
    "- Confirms installation location\n",
    "- Shows version and dependency info\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key field to check:**\n",
    "- `Location:` should point inside the `ai-maths` environment\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ Python REPL Verification (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "np.__version__\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Exit Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "exit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "- Confirms NumPy works interactively\n",
    "- Useful for notebooks and experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Final Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy is correctly installed\n",
    "- Installation happened inside the `ai-maths` virtual environment\n",
    "- `which numpy` is NOT a valid verification method\n",
    "- Correct checks are:\n",
    "  - `import numpy`\n",
    "  - `pip show numpy`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Python packages are verified using Python, not shell tools.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use:\n",
    "- `import package_name`\n",
    "- NOT `which package_name`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n"
