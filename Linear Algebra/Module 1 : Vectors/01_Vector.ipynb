    "Q1. What is a vector in simple words?\n",
    "Ans. A vector is a group of numbers treated as one object.\n",
    "It can be seen as an arrow or as data.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "v = [3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q2. What is the geometry view of a vector?\n",
    "Ans. In geometry, a vector is an arrow with direction and length.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# v = [3, 4]\n",
    "# Starts at (0, 0)\n",
    "# Ends at (3, 4)\n",
    "# Direction → where it points\n",
    "# Length → how long it is\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q3. What questions does the geometry view answer?\n",
    "Ans. It answers: which direction and how strong (how far).\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# Wind direction + wind strength can be represented as a vector\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q4. What is the data (AI) view of a vector?\n",
    "Ans. In AI, a vector is a list of features that describe something.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# v = [3, 4]\n",
    "# Feature 1 = 3\n",
    "# Feature 2 = 4\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q5. How are vectors used in AI systems?\n",
    "Ans. Vectors represent embeddings, features, or profiles.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "word_embedding = [0.21, -0.55, 0.88, 0.03]\n",
    "# Each number is one feature of the word\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q6. What is the key connection between geometry and data?\n",
    "Ans. Geometry and data use the same math.\n",
    "Angle means similarity, distance means difference.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# Small angle between vectors → similar meaning\n",
    "# Large distance → very different items\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q7. Why are vectors everywhere in AI?\n",
    "Ans. Because meaning, similarity, and strength can be measured using vectors.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# \"king\" vector and \"queen\" vector\n",
    "# Similar direction → similar meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "q='''\n",
    "Q8. What is the one-line idea to remember?\n",
    "Ans. A vector is one object with two views: arrow (geometry) and features (data).\n",

    "# Example (lock it 🔒)\n",
    "# Same vector, different interpretation\n"
