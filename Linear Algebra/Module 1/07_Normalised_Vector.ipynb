    "Q1. What is vector normalization in simple words?\n",
    "Ans. Vector normalization means changing a vector so its length becomes 1,\n",
    "without changing its direction.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# Long arrow → same direction, shorter arrow (length = 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q2. What is L2 normalization?\n",
    "Ans. L2 normalization divides a vector by its own L2 norm.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Formula\n",
    "# v_normalized = v / ||v||\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q3. How do you normalize a vector step-by-step?\n",
    "Ans. First find the norm, then divide each element by that norm.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "v = [3, 4]\n",
    "# ||v|| = 5\n",
    "# v̂ = [3/5, 4/5]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q4. What happens to the norm after normalization?\n",
    "Ans. The normalized vector always has length 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q5. What does normalization do in geometry view?\n",
    "Ans. It keeps the direction the same but removes the effect of length.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# Same arrow direction, different size → normalized to unit length\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q6. Why is normalization important in AI and embeddings?\n",
    "Ans. It allows fair comparison by removing bias caused by vector magnitude.\n",

    "# Example\n",
    "# Long document vs short document\n",
    "# Loud user vs quiet user\n",
    "\n",

    "'''\n",
    "Q7. How is normalization related to cosine similarity?\n",
    "Ans. Cosine similarity is just the dot product of normalized vectors.\n",

    "# cos_sim(v, u) = v̂ · û\n",
    "\n",

    "'''\n",
    "Q8. Where is vector normalization used in AI?\n",
    "Ans. In word embeddings, image embeddings, nearest neighbors, and contrastive learning.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# Semantic search\n",
    "# Recommendation systems\n",
    "\n",

    "Q9. What does normalization NOT change?\n",
    "Ans. It does not change direction or relative meaning.\n",
