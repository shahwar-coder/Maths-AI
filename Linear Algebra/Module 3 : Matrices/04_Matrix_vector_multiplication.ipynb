    "\n",
    "Q1. What does matrix × vector multiplication mean in simple words?\n",
    "Ans. It means a matrix takes an input vector and transforms it into a new vector.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# input vector x → matrix A → output vector y\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q2. What is the shape rule for matrix × vector multiplication?\n",
    "Ans. The number of columns in the matrix must match the size of the vector.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# Matrix A shape = (m, n)\n",
    "# Vector x shape = (n, 1)\n",
    "# Result shape   = (m, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q3. Why must the inner dimensions match?\n",
    "Ans. Because each row of the matrix needs one value from each entry of the vector.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# (2, 2) × (2, 1) → valid\n",
    "# (2, 3) × (2, 1) → ❌ invalid\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q4. How does matrix × vector multiplication work geometrically?\n",
    "Ans. Each row of the matrix takes a dot product with the vector.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "A = [\n",
    "    [1, 2],\n",
    "    [3, 4]\n",
    "]\n",
    "x = [\n",
    "    [5],\n",
    "    [6]\n",
    "]\n",
    "# Row 1 · x = 1*5 + 2*6\n",
    "# Row 2 · x = 3*5 + 4*6\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q5. Why does the output have one value per row of the matrix?\n",
    "Ans. Because each row produces exactly one dot product result.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# 2 rows in A → output vector has 2 values\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "q='''\n",
    "Q6. What is the data / AI intuition behind matrix × vector multiplication?\n",
    "Ans. The vector represents input features, and the matrix represents weights\n",
    "that compute new features.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# x = [height, weight]\n",
    "# A = weights\n",
    "# A × x → transformed features\n"

    "SET–2 : Matrix × Vector Multiplication (AI Usage & Deeper Meaning)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1. Why is matrix × vector multiplication fundamental in neural networks?\n",
    "Ans. Because each neural network layer transforms input features into new features using this operation.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# Input vector x = (features)\n",
    "# Weight matrix W = (neurons × features)\n",
    "# Output y = W × x  → neuron activations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q2. How does one row of a weight matrix relate to one neuron?\n",
    "Ans. Each row represents one neuron computing a weighted sum of inputs.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "weights_row = [0.2, 0.8]\n",
    "inputs      = [1.0, 0.5]\n",
    "# Neuron output = 0.2*1.0 + 0.8*0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q3. Why is matrix × vector multiplication considered many dot products?\n",
    "Ans. Because each row performs its own dot product with the same input vector.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# A × x =\n",
    "# [row₁ · x]\n",
    "# [row₂ · x]\n",
    "# [row₃ · x]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q4. How does this operation help create multiple output features at once?\n",
    "Ans. Each row generates one output feature, so many features are created together.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# Matrix shape (4, 10) × vector shape (10, 1)\n",
    "# Output shape = (4, 1) → 4 new features\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q5. How is matrix × vector multiplication used in Transformers?\n",
    "Ans. It projects embeddings into query, key, and value spaces.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# embedding vector x\n",
    "# Wq × x → query\n",
    "# Wk × x → key\n",
    "# Wv × x → value\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q6. Why is this operation efficient on GPUs?\n",
    "Ans. Because all dot products are independent and can be computed in parallel.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# Thousands of rows × one vector\n",
    "# All rows processed simultaneously on GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "q='''\n",
    "Q7. What is the key mental model to remember?\n",
    "Ans. A matrix asks many questions to the same vector, one per row.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# Each row asks: “How aligned am I with this input?”\n"
