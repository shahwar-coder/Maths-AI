    "Composition of Transformations — Intuition & AI Meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1. What does composition of transformations mean?\n",
    "Ans. Composition means applying one transformation after another, where the final result depends on the order of application.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# First scale a square, then rotate it → final shape\n",
    "# Rotate first, then scale → different final shape\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q2. Why does the order of transformations matter?\n",
    "Ans. Because each transformation acts on the result of the previous one, changing the space before the next step.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# Stretching a shape and then rotating it\n",
    "# is not the same as rotating first and then stretching\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q3. How is composition represented using matrices?\n",
    "Ans. Composition of transformations is represented by matrix multiplication.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# Apply A first, then B:\n",
    "# v → A → B\n",
    "# Combined effect = B × A\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q4. Why does the rightmost matrix act first?\n",
    "Ans. Because matrix multiplication follows function composition rules, where the innermost operation is applied first.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# B(A(v)) means A acts on v first, then B acts on the result\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q5. What is the visual intuition behind composing transformations?\n",
    "Ans. Each transformation reshapes space, and the next transformation reshapes the already modified space.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# Bend a wire first, then stretch it\n",
    "# Stretch first, then bend → different outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q6. How is composition used in neural networks?\n",
    "Ans. Each neural network layer is a transformation, and stacking layers composes multiple transformations.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# input → layer1 → layer2 → layer3 → output\n",
    "# Each layer builds on the previous one\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "q='''\n",
    "Q7. Why does composing many transformations make deep learning powerful?\n",
    "Ans. Because repeated small transformations can create complex and expressive representations.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# One linear transform = simple change\n",
    "# Many composed transforms = complex decision boundaries\n"
