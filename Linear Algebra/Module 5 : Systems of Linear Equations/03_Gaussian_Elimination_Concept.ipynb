    "Q1. What is Gaussian elimination in simple words?\n",
    "A.\n",
    "Gaussian elimination is a step-by-step method to simplify a system of equations\n",
    "until the solution becomes easy to see.\n",
    "It removes confusion by reducing equations one variable at a time.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# Start with:\n",
    "# 2x + y = 5\n",
    "# x + 3y = 6\n",
    "# Rearrange and simplify step by step to make solving easier\n",

    "Q2. What problem does Gaussian elimination try to solve?\n",
    "A.\n",
    "It solves the problem of many equations with many unknowns that are tangled together.\n",
    "The goal is to untangle them into a simpler form.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# Ax = b\n",

    "Q3. What does “elimination” actually mean?\n",
    "A.\n",
    "Elimination means using one equation to remove a variable from another equation,\n",
    "so each equation becomes simpler than before.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# Eq1: x + y = 4\n",

    "'''\n",
    "Q4. Why does Gaussian elimination aim for a staircase shape?\n",
    "A.\n",
    "The staircase (step-like) form ensures each equation focuses on a new variable.\n",
    "This makes solving variables one-by-one straightforward.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# First row → solve x\n",

    "Q5. Why are row operations allowed in Gaussian elimination?\n",
    "A.\n",
    "Each row represents an equation.\n",
    "Changing rows means rewriting equations in an equivalent way without changing the solution.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# Swapping equations or adding equations together\n",
